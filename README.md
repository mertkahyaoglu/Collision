mini-libgdx
=========

This is a mini game framework built on top of LibGDX. I needed to write my own framework because whenever I wanted to write a basic game, I had to write some codes over and over again. Here is a demo game built with it.

###Collision

Collision is a skill and attention seeking game. You need to avoid collision with red balls as long as you can.
